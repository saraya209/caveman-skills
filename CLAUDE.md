# Repository Instructions

## Purpose

This repo publishes six Julius Brussee agent skills for now: `caveman`, `interface-kit`, `grill-me`, `loop-factory`, `junior-to-senior`, and `fuck-slop`. Treat it as an installable skill collection, not a product website.

## Editing Rules

- Keep skill files in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- Every skill needs YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`.
- Keep descriptions action-oriented. They should say when the skill triggers and what workflow it provides.
- Use progressive disclosure. Put long references in `references/` and link them from `SKILL.md`.
- Do not add generated build artifacts.
- Do not vendor third-party plugin caches.

## Voice

Repo copy may be concise, but skill bodies should stay clear enough for agents to follow. Caveman branding belongs in Caveman skills and public-facing README sections, not every skill.

## Quality Bar

Before committing:

```bash
node scripts/verify-skills.mjs
node scripts/list-skills.mjs
```

For `interface-kit` changes, preserve priorities:

- accessibility
- performance
- typography
- layout and spatial design
- color semantics
- motion and interaction
- polish
